# FSM-Based-Vending-Machine-Design

## Introduction
Automation has transformed the modern world. Today, instead of shopkeepers manually selling items, we have automated machines that accept payments and dispense products. Vending machines are devices where customers insert coins or use credit cards to buy items like newspapers, snacks, beverages, or tickets. They offer a highly practical purchasing method.
A vending machine operates as a sequential circuit, dispensing various products upon receiving a request. This can be modeled using a Finite State Machine (FSM) based on the Moore model. The vending machine's functionality is implemented in Verilog HDL and simulated in ModelSim. 
The Vending Machine follows FIFO characteristic. 

This project focuses on a vending machine that dispenses items that the user can customise/visualise. 

## Results
The functioning of the machine has been verified as shown in the waveform below.
